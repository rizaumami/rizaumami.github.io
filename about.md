I rarely write an article, but when I do, I do it on this [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
This Pages is a blog about things me think is interesting, or just a quick note about a thing so I'm not forget about it.

~~Comments are warmly welcome, but as it's powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) then you need to turn on your javascript.  
And if that's bothered you~~ (I've temporarily disabled disqus comment system), feel free to contact one of my contacts listed below.

If you think this Pages is worth to follow, just [`click this subscribe link`]({{site.url}}/feed.xml) to get its RSS feed.
